# Review findings & recorded deviations

Deferred findings from rotating-model review panels. These are accepted
deviations or future work items — not blockers.

## M1: opencode-schema

- none outstanding (two wire bugs found by review were fixed in `fixup:` commits).

## M2: opencode-llm

- MINOR (executor): TS threads `Headers.CurrentRedactedNames` through the
  executor; Rust redacts only the fixed SENSITIVE_NAME set. No call sites need
  it today — revisit when custom secret-bearing headers are configurable.
- MINOR (executor): body truncation measures bytes with char-boundary
  fallback vs TS UTF-16 code units; truncation points differ for multibyte
  bodies. Test-only impact.
- MINOR (executor): `redact_url`/URL parsing is more lenient than WHATWG
  `URL.canParse`; non-sensitive URLs are passed through un-normalized.
- MINOR (executor): `secret_values` short-value filter uses chars() count vs
  UTF-16 length — astral-plane secrets only.
- MINOR (anthropic): `usage` payloads typed as raw `Value` vs TS
  schema-validated `AnthropicUsage`; shape validation happens at use sites.
- CONVENTION: f64-typed wire numbers serialize as x.0 vs integer — golden
  comparisons must be numeric-tolerant (applies to all future milestones).

## M3: opencode-core foundation

- MINOR (bus): TS `readAggregate` (paged, manifest-filtered read),
  `beforeAggregateRead` hook, `allBounded`/`SubscriberOverflowError` not
  ported — deliberate deferral until a consumer needs them (M5 session engine).
- MINOR (storage): migration journal seeds all rows with one now_ms() value;
  TS stamps per row. Not observable in fresh-DB flows.
- RefreshListener bridge to models.dev catalog implemented (M3.6).
